## Technical Decisions

### Client

#### Fetching

I chose the combination of React Query and Axios. React Query handles data workflows efficiently, offering error handling and caching, while Axios allows for easy customization of HTTP clients and requests.

#### UI Libraries

I combined Material UI and TailwindCSS for UI development. This approach offers a variety of ready-to-use components with straightforward customization options.

#### Form Validation

For form validation, I selected React Hook Form and Yup. These libraries integrate well with TypeScript, and Yupâ€™s builder is well-documented with clear usage examples.

### Server

#### Communication between server and client

I opted for GraphQL over REST, considering that your product utilizes this technology.

#### Authentication

For authentication, I selected JWT instead of Sessions, given that your platform manages a large volume of user data. Storing all sessions on your servers could become costly. Additionally, JWT eliminates the need for extra requests to verify user session status.

#### Schema builder

I decided to use Mongoose due to its popularity as a MongoDB schema builder. It has strong community support and comprehensive documentation.
